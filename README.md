## Overview
This assignment was an introduction to Plotly.  I was able to build a website utilizing a drop down menu to sort data and display it in a number of different graphs.  This was very challenging, but I can see how it would get easier with practice.  I think I will use this website as a tool to practice new skills as I learn them.
